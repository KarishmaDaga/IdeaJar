# IdeaJar
A collection of ideas from when my mind drifts.


- Something for dealing with burnout/promoting self care
- App that tracks if you're going to lecture (location tracking, calendars)
- Visualize a City.
  - Choose a city, and see a visualization of the city based on the number of times people said they were ‘there’ on Instagram. Access Google API to categorize the locations based on ‘type’: food and restaurant, scenic areas, landmarks, etc. When you hover over a point, display the name of the location and a link to a google maps of it.
  - Directed towards tourism, would be nice addition on AirBnB or a website on its own.
- _______________ : Create iOS app that shows students coffee places with open work spaces and noise level based on distance (from them), time, and day of the week. 
- Claro: Chrome Extension -> Learn a language the way natives speak. Open up Netflix, watch a show in the language you wish to learn, and enjoy having a sidebar of the meanings of vocab used in the show cascade down. 
- Linear Algebra on Photographs: apply cool transformations on photographs app/website
- Recording Lectures App: an aesthetically pleasing recorder that isn’t complicated and produces a good recording of a lecture/etc. can import the mp3 file as a podcast into the apple podcast app.
